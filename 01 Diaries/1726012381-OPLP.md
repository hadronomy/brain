# Obsidian with Neovim

Working with `Obsidian` and `Neovim` is a great experience.
Combining the note-taking prowess of `Obsidian` with the editing power
of `Neovim`.

## Configuration

First I had to install the `Obsidian` plugin for `Neovim` my plugin manager of
choice `lazy.nvim` by adding the following file to my `~/.config/nvim/plugin`
directory.

```lua
-- ~/.config/nvim/plugin/obsidian.lua
return {
  "epwalsh/obsidian.nvim",
  version = "*", -- recommended, use latest release instead of latest commit
  lazy = true,
  ft = "markdown",
  -- Replace the above line with this if you only want to load obsidian.nvim for markdown files in your vault:
  -- event = {
  --   -- If you want to use the home shortcut '~' here you need to call 'vim.fn.expand'.
  --   -- E.g. "BufReadPre " .. vim.fn.expand "~" .. "/my-vault/**.md"
  --   "BufReadPre path/to/my-vault/**.md",
  --   "BufNewFile path/to/my-vault/**.md",
  -- },
  dependencies = {
    -- Required.
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
  },
  opts = {
    workspaces = {
      {
        name = "personal",
        path = "~/obsidian-vault",
      },
    },

  },
  keys = {
    { "<leader>sO", ":ObsidianSearch<CR>", desc = "Search in Obsidian" },
  },
}
```

## Usage

This plugins add markdown syntax highlighting to `Obsidian` files and,
managing the frontmatter of the notes. It also adds a `:ObsidianSearch`
command alongside multiple other commands.

So now enjoy :enjoy: making your second brain with the power of `Neovim`.
