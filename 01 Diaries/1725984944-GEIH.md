# Synch `wsl` and `windows` directories

At first I was designing a complex multiple remotes git repository to
synch my `wsl` and `windows` directories.

But after some research I found out about [unison](https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison)
which is a simple tool to synch directories.

I just had to install it on the `wsl` side

```bash
yay -S unison
```

And just run the following command to synch the directories

```bash
unison ~/obsidian-vault /mnt/c/Users/pablo/Documents/ObsidianVault -auto -repeat=watch -prefer /home/hadronomy/obsidian-vault
```

The first two arguments are the directories to synch, the `-auto` flag
ensures that the changes are propagated automatically, the `-repeat=watch`
keep the process running and watching for changes and
the `-prefer /home/hadronomy/obsidian-vault` flag ensures that the conflicts
are resolved by keeping the `wsl` version.
