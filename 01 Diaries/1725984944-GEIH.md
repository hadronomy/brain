# Synch `wsl` and `windows` directories

## Motivation

At first I was designing a complex multiple remotes git repository to
synch my `wsl` and `windows` directories. I know that I can just
`cd` into the `/mnt/c/...` directory and work there but
lets just say that for every command that I run while in
the windows side, I have to wait for _5 seconds_ for the
`starship` prompt to show up.

But after some research I found out about [unison](https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison)
which is a simple tool to synch directories.

## Solution

As after testing the tool I found it to be very simple and effective
so I decided to use it.

I just had to install it on the `wsl` side

```sh
yay -S unison
```

And just run the following command to synch the directories

```sh
unison ~/obsidian-vault /mnt/c/Users/pablo/Documents/ObsidianVault \
-auto -repeat=watch -prefer /home/hadronomy/obsidian-vault
```

The first two arguments are the directories to synch, the `-auto` flag
ensures that the changes are propagated automatically, the `-repeat=watch`
keep the process running and watching for changes and
the `-prefer /home/hadronomy/obsidian-vault` flag ensures that the conflicts
are resolved by keeping the `wsl` version.
