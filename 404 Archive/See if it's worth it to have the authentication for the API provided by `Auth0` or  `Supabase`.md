## Description

`Supabase` and `Auth0` provide authentication services with all the security features already implemented. Using any also solves the problem of not having a `free` way of hosting a database for authentication.

The problem is that `ease of use` is not what I'm looking for right now, I want to make my own database structure with my own API implementation, without having to interface with `Auth0` or `Supabase`.

## Solution

For now, until I can self-host `Postgresql` use the `Supabase postgresql connection` to host my database.
