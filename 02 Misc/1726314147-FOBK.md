## Description

Tempo is a new library in a proud tradition of JavaScript date and time libraries.
Inspired by the likes of moment.js, day.js, and date-fns
Tempo is built from the ground up to be as small and easy to use as possible.

Tempo is best thought of as a collection of utilities for working
with `Date` objects â€” an important distinction from other libraries
that provide custom date primitives. Under the hood,
Tempo mines JavaScript's `Intl.DateTimeFormat` to extract complex data like
timezones offsets and locale aware date formats giving you
a simple API to format, parse, and manipulates dates.

Tempo is tiny tree-shakable framework, you can only take what you need.
All functionality is available in **5.2 kB for esm**
and **5.5 kB for cjs** modules (minified and brotlied).
[Size Limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) controls the size.
