The **Zettelkasten** method is a way to manage notes and
ideas using a network of interconnected notes.
Each note is a self-contained piece of information that can be linked to other notes.

For example, this note is linked to the [[index|My Second Brain]] note.

## Common Questions

- [How many Zettelkastens should I have?](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/how-many-zettelkasten/) The answer is, most likely, only one
  for the duration of your life.
- Don't use categories. Use tags instead.
- "What should my first note be" It doesn't matter. Just start writing.
- Set links between notes. Full-text search on it's own provides not enough information.
