## Configuration

The intention is for the configuration to be a **flexible system**,
able to **accept multiple languages** for the configuration files.

### Languages

Currently I plan to Implement the following languages:

- [ ] Lua

The `lua` config should be designed to be as simple and
flexible as possible.
A good example of this is how the configuration for
[lazy.nvim](03%20Zettelkasten/1726250893-CMKY.md) is implemented.

Something like this:

```lua
return {
  -- This is a comment
  -- This is a key
  name = "my-lovely-template"
  key = "value",
  -- This is a list
  list = { "value1", "value2" },
  -- This is a nested table
  nested = {
    key = "value"
  },
  function = function()
    print("Hello, World!")
  end
}
```

- [ ] Typescript

Similarly, the `typescript` configuration should be
as standard as possible.

Following the example of mayor projects like `nextjs` or `astro`.
With a `midas.config.ts` file that exports a default object
typed with the configuration interface.

```typescript
import { config } from "midas";

export default config({
  name: "my-lovely-template",
  key: "value",
  list: ["value1", "value2"],
  nested: {
    key: "value",
  },
  function() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
  },
});
```
